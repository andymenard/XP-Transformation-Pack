Built for the installed ARM64 KWin 6.7.5 / Qt6.11 environment.

Geometry test passed: linear start/midpoint/end, fixed caption height, opaque
rendering at 1x, 1.5x, 2.5x and 3x. Virtual KWin sessions passed maximize,
unmaximize, minimize, taskbar-equivalent restore, interrupted transitions and
close during animation. Runtime logs show ordinary transitions completing at
256ms (250ms nominal, quantized to the 16ms timer/frame schedule).

Installed in ~/.local/lib/qt6/plugins/kwin/effects/plugins/, enabled in kwinrc
and confirmed in the real compositor's loadedEffects list. Live user visual
comparison remains to be done; the automated tests used virtual sessions.

Native source is kept here and in the existing Git checkout's effects folder.
This effect has not been published in OTA or added to the cross-distro GUI
installer yet; other KWin versions need a matching build/API port.

## Kubuntu source-build release 0.2.2

- Ubuntu 26.04 container, ARM64, KWin 6.6.6, Qt 6.10.2: full native build,
  caption tests and ldd -r symbol/library checks passed.
- Local builder ran as an unprivileged desktop user, installed the tested
  module, then reused it on the second run without recompiling.
- KWin 6.6 uses the exported renderer factory for the overlay image item and
  the four-argument prePaintWindow API. The 6.7 implementation is retained.
- 28 updater/build/outline tests passed. Signed 0.2.1 -> 0.2.2 optional-feature
  install and rollback passed for AMD64 Qt 6.10 and ARM64 Qt 6.11 fixtures.
- Physical Kubuntu AMD64 desktop activation has not been tested here.
